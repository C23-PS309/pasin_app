Pasin ni boss,
Senggol dong.

# **Welcome to PAS.IN**
PAS.IN is an innovative Android application designed to provide clothing size recommendations for the users that are accurate and quick, with the existence of a real-time body measurement system based on an image of the user's body. With its user-friendly interface and powerful features, PAS.IN aims to helps reduce clothing waste by making it easier for users to find the right size clothing. PAS.IN also strives to reduce clothing waste by supporting sustainable fashion concepts, such as the use of eco-friendly materials and more sustainable production practices. In practice, PAS.IN can function as an mobile platform where users can enter their body measurements and style preferences to get clothing recommendations that suit their needs. This helps reduce the purchase of clothes that are not the right size, which in turn reduces the amount of textile waste generated.

## Features
- Predict Body Size: PAS.IN can predict the user's body size based on input photos, height, and age. The predicted size is the width of the shoulders and hip.
  
- Predict Clothing Size: PAS.IN can predict the user's clothing size based on data from previous body size predictions.
  
- Measurement History: This application can store data of previous measurements based on user accounts.

## Implementation
To implement PAS.IN, follow these steps:

**[Step 1]:** Create a UI/UX design using figma.

![iPhone_13_Pro_1](https://github.com/C23-PS309/pasin_app/assets/81060784/c267ff24-3efd-4d49-bfc5-116e946ebcc3)

**[Step 2]:** Develop an application based on the mockup that was created from the previous step in Android Studio using Kotlin. The code can be seen in the pasin_app repository.

**[Step 3]:** 
Create machine learning models. The ML_Model is a machine learning model used in the PAS.IN application, which provides predictions for body measurements and suitable clothing sizes. In its implementation, it is divided into two algorithms: body measurement prediction and size prediction. The body measurement prediction algorithm aims to predict body measurements based on the input data. The output of this prediction is then used as input for the clothing size prediction model. The clothing size prediction model is implemented using a softmax regression model, which is a type of artificial neural network. The model uses a softmax activation layer in its output layer to generate the predicted clothing size. The code can be seen in the ML_Model repository.
